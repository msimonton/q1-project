<h3>Input</h3>

<div id="input_text">
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
  Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
  My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
  I had to stop for the night

  There she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell
  And I was thinking to myself, 'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
  Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
  There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say

  Welcome to the Hotel California
  Such a lovely place such a lovely face
  Plenty of room at the Hotel California
  Any time of year, you can find it here

  Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
  She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
  How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

  So I called up the Captain, Please bring me my wine
  He said, We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine
  And still those voices are calling from far away
  Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say

  Welcome to the Hotel California

  Such a lovely place such a lovely face
  They livin' it up at the Hotel California
  What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

  Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
  She said, "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
  And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
  The stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast

  Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
  Relax, said the night man, we are programmed to receive
  You can checkout any time you like, but you can never leave

  Welcome to the Hotel California
  Such a lovely place such a lovely face
  They livin' it up at the Hotel California
  What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
